# Crowdfunding_ETL
For the ETL mini project, we will work on building an ETL pipeline using Python, Pandas, and either Python dictionary methods or regular expressions to extract and transform the data. We used both Python dictionary method and regular expressions to extract and transform the data. 
After transforming the data, we will create four CSV files and use the CSV file data to create an ERD and a table schema. Finally, weâ€™ll upload the CSV file data into a Postgres database.
